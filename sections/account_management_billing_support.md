## AWS Organizations

- Global service
- Allows to manage **multiple AWS accounts**
- The main account is the master account
- Cost Benefits:
  - Consolidated Billing across all accounts - single payment method
  - Pricing benefits from aggregated usage (volume discount for EC2, S3…)
  - Pooling of Reserved EC2 instances for optimal savings
- API is available to **automate AWS account creation**
- Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies (SCP)

## Multi Account Strategies

- Create accounts per **department**, per **cost center**, per **dev / test / prod**, based on regulatory restrictions (using SCP), for better resource isolation (ex: VPC), to have separate per-account service limits, isolated account for logging
- Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
- Use tagging standards for billing purposes
- Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
- Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account

## Service Control Policies (SCP)

- Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions
- Applied at the OU or Account level
- Does not apply to the Master Account
- SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles of the Account, including Root user
- The SCP does not affect service-linked roles
  - Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations and can't be restricted by SCPs.
- SCP must have an explicit Allow (does not allow anything by default)
- Use cases:
  - Restrict access to certain services (for example: can’t use EMR)
  - Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services

## AWS Organization - Consolidated Billing

- When enabled, provides you with:
  - Combined Usage – combine the usage across all AWS accounts in the AWS Organization to share the volume pricing, Reserved Instances and Savings Plans discounts
  - One Bill – get one bill for all AWS Accounts in the AWS Organization
- The management account can turn off Reserved Instances discount sharing for any account in the AWS Organization, including itself

## AWS Control Tower

- Easy way to set up and govern a secure and compliant multi-account AWS environment based on best practices
- Benefits:
  - Automate the set up of your environment in a few clicks
  - Automate ongoing policy management using guardrails
  - Detect policy violations and remediate them
  - Monitor compliance through an interactive dashboard
- AWS Control Tower runs on top of AWS Organizations:
  - It automatically sets up AWS Organizations to organize accounts and implement SCPs (Service Control Policies)

## AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM)

- Share AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts
- Share with any account or within your Organization
- Avoid resource duplication!
- Supported resources include Aurora, VPC Subnets, Transit Gateway, Route 53, EC2 Dedicated Hosts, License Manager Configurations.

## AWS Service Catalog

- Users that are new to AWS have too many options, and may create stacks that are not compliant or in line with the rest of the organization
- Some users just want a quick self-service portal to launch a set of authorized products pre-defined by admins
- Includes: virtual machines, databases, storage options, etc…
- Enter AWS Service Catalog!

## Pricing Models in AWS

- AWS has 4 pricing models:
- **Pay as you go**: pay for what you use, remain agile, responsive, meet scale demands
- **Save when you reserve**: minimize risks, predictably manage budgets, comply with long-terms requirements
  - Reservations are available for EC2 Reserved Instances, DynamoDB Reserved Capacity, ElastiCache Reserved Nodes, RDS Reserved Instance, Redshift Reserved Nodes
- **Pay less by using more**: volume-based discounts
- **Pay less as AWS grows**

## Tagging and Resource Groups

- Tags are used for organizing resources:
  - EC2: instances, images, load balancers, security groups…
  - RDS, VPC resources, Route 53, IAM users, etc…
  - Resources created by CloudFormation are all tagged the same way
- Free naming, common tags are: Name, Environment, Team …
- Tags can be used to create **Resource Groups**
  - Create, maintain, and view a collection of resources that share common tags
  - Manage these tags using the Tag Editor

## Cost and Usage Reports

- Dive deeper into your AWS costs and usage
- The AWS Cost & Usage Report contains the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available, including additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, and reservations (e.g., Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RIs)).
- The AWS Cost & Usage Report lists AWS usage for each service category used by an account and its IAM users in hourly or daily line items, as well as any tags that you have activated for cost allocation purposes.
- Can be integrated with Athena, Redshift or QuickSight

## Cost Explorer

- Visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time
- Create custom reports that analyze cost and usage data.
- Analyze your data at a high level: total costs and usage across all accounts
- Or Monthly, hourly, resource level granularity
- Choose an optimal **Savings Plan**(to lower prices on your bill)
- **Forecast usage up to 12 months based on previous usage**

- Cost Explorer – Monthly Cost by AWS Service
- Cost Explorer– Hourly & Resource Level
- Cost Explorer – Savings Plan Alternative to Reserved Instances
- Cost Explorer – Forecast Usage

## Billing Alarms in CloudWatch

- Billing data metric is stored in CloudWatch us-east1
- Billing data are for overall worldwide AWS costs
- It’s for actual cost, not for projected costs
- Intended a simple alarm (not as powerful as AWS Budgets)

## AWS Budgets

- 2 budgets are free, then $0.02/day/budget

## AWS Cost Anomaly Detection

- Continuously monitor your cost and usage using ML to detect unusual spends
- It learns your unique, historic spend patterns to detect one-time cost spike
and/or continuous cost increases (you don't need to define thresholds)
- Monitor AWS services, member accounts, cost allocation tags, or cost categories
- Sends you the anomaly detection report with root-cause analysis
- Get notified with individual alerts or daily/weekly summary (using SNS)

## AWS Service Quotas

- Notify you when you're close to a service quota value threshold
